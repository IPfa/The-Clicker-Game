# The Clicker Game
The Clicker Game is a pet project in GUI development area. Once the game was started a pop up window opens. On the bottom is a running timer and on the game field are 25 random number in range from 1 to 999. Every game start recreates the game field and numbers. The target is to click on numbes in ascending order and do it as soon as possible. In case player clicked on the wrong number nothing happens. If the number was correct, number icon will be greyed out. After deactivation of the last button player gets a message notifying aboutvthe final game time. Feel free to challange your friends and find out who is faster.
